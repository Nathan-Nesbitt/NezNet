# Image CNN
This is a simple python implementation of 

## Data

The data used is the [Intel Image Classification dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)
which consists of a `train`, `test`, and `predict` folders, all containing 
images of

1. Buildings
2. Forests
3. Glaciers
4. Mountains
5. Seas
6. Streets

The test and train have labeled folders for each of the image sets (which is 
necessary to train and test the model) and the predict simply has a folder full
of images that are not labeled.

## Setup

We need to start off by cloning the images into the `data` directory. The 
images are approximately 330MB which is not super large, but they are provided
in a zip file which needs to be unzipped.

## Running

To run the model
